\chapter{introduction}
This is an introduction to the security guide, it lays out the aims of the guide and describes the security assertions that an OpenStack Deployment which follows this guide will meet. The guide explores the differences between public and private cloud deployments but the guide itself draws no distinction. Generally public clouds have the highest security requirements which is what this document reflects but as followers of the guide are free to choose which parts they implement, the level of security attained is variable.
