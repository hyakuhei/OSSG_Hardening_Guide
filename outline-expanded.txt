* OpenStack System Security Guide: Introduction and General Principles

The OpenStack System Security General Principles provides a general overview of security best practices, guidelines and recommendations for increasing the security of an OpenStack cloud deployment.  The guidance provided here is generic enough to apply to most OpenStack deployments.  Security requirements should ultimately be driven by the sensitivity of information to be transmitted, processed or stored within the OpenStack cloud.

  - How to use this guide
    - All clouds are different, read sections that apply to you
    - Test in a non-production environment
    - Provide feedback and help improve the guide

  - Architecture Guidance
    - Looking at key decision points and how they affect security
    - provide the information needed to understand security relevance of choices
    - don't necessarily suggest a specific choice, unless there're clear winners
    - largely point to sections below for additional details

  - Areas presented in this document include:
    - System and Communications Protection
    - Log Management
    - Configuration Management
    - Identification and Authentication
    - Incident Response
    - Risk Assessment
    - System and Information Integrity

  - General principles 
The general principles outlined here assume that each of the security areas listed is applied to each 
of OpenStack's components.  For example, when considering how to secure Nova, we should look at all 
software components and review each area to determine how it effects Nova (System and Communications 
Protection, Log Management, Configuration Management, and so on..).  Some components such as hypervisor 
security may have additional best practices listed within a given area.  All areas may not apply but 
it is best to run through each area and ask the questions.

When thinking about the security areas, we should in general:

    - Assume attackers are in all parts of the cloud
      - Use layered security
      - Use least privilege
      - Use encryption and authentication
    - Reduce attack surface
      - Isolate components to the greatest degree possible
      	- Mandatory Access Controls, AppArmour/SELinux
      	- Containers 
    - Keep it simple, reduce amount of software
    - Continuously monitor and verify cloud

* OpenStack Overview
    - OpenStack Core Projects vs Production OpenStack Deployment
      - deployment involves much more than just core projects
      - many configuration options
      - many architectural decisions

    - Generic view of an OpenStack deployment
      - System services, ports and protocols table
    - OpenStack Data flow
      - [insert OpenStack flow diagrams for each service]

* Securing OpenStack Components
    - Compute (Nova)
      - Configuration Guidance
      	- Hypervisor Security
	  Isolate guests using system level access control to contain hypervisor/guest vm breaches.
	  Adoption of stronger security at this layer may not be possible with all hypervisors.
      	  - KVM on RHEL
	    - sVirt on SELinux is an option
	  - KVM on Ubuntu
      	  - Xen  
      	  - ESX
      	  - LXC
      	  - HyperV ??
      	  - General measures for securing hypervisors
      	  - Refer to section below in hypervisor security
