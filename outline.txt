Introduction
* General principles
  - Assume attackers are in all parts of the cloud
    - Use layered security
    - Use least privilege
    - Use encryption and authentication
  - Reduce attack surface
    - Isolate components to the greatest degree possible
      - Mandetory Access Controls, AppArmour/SELinux
      - Containers 
    - Keep it simple, reduce amount of software
  - Continuously monitor and verify cloud
* How to use this guide
  - All clouds are different, read sections that apply to you
  - Test in a non-production environment
  - Provide feedback and help improve the guide

OpenStack Overview
* OpenStack Core Projects vs Production OpenStack Deployment
  - deployment involves much more than just core projects
  - many configuration options
  - many architectural decisions
* Generic view of an OpenStack deployment

Architecture Guidance
* Looking at key decision points and how they affect security
  - provide the information needed to understand security relavence of choices
  - don't necessarily suggest a specific choice, unless there're clear winners
  - largely point to sections below for additional details
* Configuration options for core projects
* How to organize software on controller(s)
* Choice of external projects necessary for deployment (e.g., hypervisor)
